## üéØ Design Decisions & Assumptions Made
Authentication:
JWT-based authentication is used for stateless and scalable user session management. Each protected route requires a valid token in the Authorization header.

Authorization:
Only the user who created a review can update or delete it. Admin roles are not implemented since it's a user-focused review system.

Modular Structure:
Code is organized into controllers, models, and routes to ensure clean separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

Error Handling:
Simple and consistent error responses (with proper HTTP status codes) are returned to the client for debugging.

Validation:
Input validation is handled through middleware to ensure incoming data is safe and complete before hitting database logic.

Environment Config:
Sensitive credentials like database URI and JWT secret are stored in a .env file for security and easy environment switching.

Database Assumption:
MongoDB is assumed to be running locally or in the cloud (e.g., MongoDB Atlas), and accessible via the configured connection string.

Review Constraint:
Each user can submit only one review per book to prevent duplicate reviews and ensure fairness.
